<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is AKERELE KEHINDE JOSHUA, I am a graduate of the University of Ibadan. I have a bachelor's degree in Sociology and I am a web3 enthusiast. I have tried to look for job for months after graduation but I couldn't find a good job before I made up my mind to learn a good tech skill that can get me a good paying job and I won't have to settle for less, so I chose front end website development.</p>

<p> I believe I have what it takes to be a website developer/software engineer. I'm putting in the work and I know it's going to pay off sometime soon. I have enrolled for couple training bootcamps which will help me during this learning phase and equip me with the neccessary and sufficient resources needed to excel in this new career path. I am committed and it's only a matter of time before things begin to get shape and turn out good</p>

<p>With the pace I'm going at, i plan to be able to create my own website and work on my own without help in few weeks time, maybe 6 to 8 weeks, lol. i will give all i have and i trust in God because He will surely give me Grace. I cant wait to work for you lots. 11th oct. 2023</p>
